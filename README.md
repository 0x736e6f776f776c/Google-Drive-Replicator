# Backup for Google Drive
A tool to back up your Google Drive.
## What does this tool do?
After running the script and authenticating with your Google account, you can copy all the files in a given Google Drive or a specified folder to any other place in your Google Drive. You have the option to copy the files to multiple destinations. You can also select a smart backup option, so that the files you've already backed up will be left out the next time you back up a Drive or folder. This tool works for Person/My Drives and for Shared Drives.
## Instructions
1. Coming soon, the project is currently awaiting verification by Google to go public.
## Future goals
- Right now the file structure is not taken into account. This means the files are all copied straight to the root of the given destination folder or Drive. Somewhere in the future I plan to add the ability for the program to replicate the file structure so that all files will be placed into replicas of the original folders.
