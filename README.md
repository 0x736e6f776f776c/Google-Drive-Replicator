# Google Drive Replicator by TechSnowOwl
A tool to replicate your Google Drive files in a fast and simple matter
## What does this tool do?
After running the script and authenticating with your Google account, you can copy all the files in a given Google Drive or a specified folder to any other place in Google Drive. You have the option to copy the files to multiple destinations. You can also select a smart backup option, so that the files you've already backed up will be left out the next time you back up a Drive or folder. This tool works for Personal/My Drives and for Shared Drives.
## Instructions
1. Go to the [release](https://github.com/techsnowowl/Backup-for-Google-Drive/releases/tag/1.0) and download the *setup.exe*. You could also clone the repository, if you prefer that.
2. - If you downloaded *setup.exe*, run it, and choose where you wish to save the program files. Then open the folder, the name should be *Backup for Google Drive*
   - If you cloned the repository, go to the *Backup Google Drive* folder.
3. Now that you're in the folder, you should see 2 Python (.py) files and one *credentials.json* file. Double click the *Backup_Google_Drive.py* file to run the program
