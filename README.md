# Backup for Google Drive
A tool to back up your Google Drive by copying all the files to another place.
## What does this tool do?
After running the script and authenticating with your Google account, you can copy all the files in a given Google Drive or a specified folder to any other place in your Google Drive. You have the option to copy the files to multiple destinations. You can also select a smart backup option, so that the files you've already backed up will be left out the next time you back up a Drive or folder. This tool works for Person/My Drives and for Shared Drives.
## Instructions
1. Coming soon, the project is currently awaiting verification by Google to go public.
