# Google Drive Replicator by TechSnowOwl
A tool to replicate your Google Drive files in a fast and simple matter
## What does this tool do?
After running the script and authenticating with your Google account, you can copy all the files in a given Google Drive or a specified folder to any other place in Google Drive that you can access. You have the option to copy the files to multiple destinations at once. You can also select smart backup option, so that the files you've already copied once will be left out the next time you back up a Drive or folder. This tool works for Personal/My Drives and for Shared Drives.
